<h1>I am Daniel Mark</h1>  
<body>
  <p>I am an Indonesian student, who came to Canada to pursue a career in the web design industry.
    <div>I have only been in <abbr tittle="Canada">CA</abbr> for almost a month. I arrived here on August 28 <sup>th</sup>.</div> It has been an interesting time here. I am getting to know more about Ottawa.<span>&#128512;</span>  
  
  <div>I like to be active.<div>There are a few activities that i like to do, for instance : <li>working out</li> <li>outdoor activities</li> <li>doing chores</li></div> </p>   
  <p>In addition, i am not a picky eater. I like all kinds of foods. 
  <div>However, these are my favorites: <em><ul>Vermecilli Salad</ul> <ul>Fried Rice</ul> <ul>Sandwich</ul> <ul>Roasted Duck</ul></em> </div></p>
  <div>I am pretty quiet at first, but once you get to know me, we will have an endless laugh <span>&#128541</span></div>
  <div>I heard one saying,<blockquote> <em> <strong> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. </strong> </em> </blockquote> </div>
  <div> I think it is true, that we need to begin something in order to finish something</div>
